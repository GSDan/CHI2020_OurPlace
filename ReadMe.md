Related work:

further foreground the need for this work in the background sections, noting that while there are many existing m-learning projects which utilise creativity and constructionism (e.g. Zydeco [AC, R1, R2], see below) there exists little generalisable guidance on how these technologies could be used by teachers within complex real-world PBL contexts, or field-testing of such guidance.

Framework overview:

suggest how the framework could be used with existing comparable mobile learning projects. Each stage’s first paragraph will feature an example using an existing project (e.g. using Zydeco during the research phase, or using Science Everywhere to share public entities in the wild) before how we applied it using OurPlace (AC, R1, R2). To contextualise this, these projects will first be introduced in the ‘Mobile Learning’ subsection of the Related Work.

Methodology:

parental consent and anonymisation; 
data collection during the engagements (all were audio recorded, with jigsaws photographed, digital activities uploaded);
the influence and role of the researcher during the engagements (including how much the teachers were informed about the framework’s development;
the process of the interviews with teachers;
our criteria and purpose of the analysis;
how we reviewed, transcribed and compiled the different types of data (re-listening to all audio and transcribing clear speech, collating sources of data (audio, photos, writing) by class and date);
the coding process (coding line-by-line, inductive and exploratory before categorized into themes). 
We will list the themes (the discussion’s subsection headings) and breadcrumb that the reported findings in the following studies section pertain to these themes to solidify the link between the findings and analysis

Studies:

The framework’s evolution and adaptation over the course of the studies will be highlighted to ease transitions and clarify the impact of DBR (e.g. the introduction of the prototype phase in response to the first configuration).
Cover how the schools were selected. add this detail to their individual descriptions in the existing studies section. 
The details of how the students gave oral and written feedback (e.g. one class wrote letters, another reflected during a school assembly).
